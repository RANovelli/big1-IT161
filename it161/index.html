       <p>I'm a guitar player, songwriter, touring musician, record collector, and DJ, with a deep interest in all things Mid-Century. I'm currently in the process of getting my Italian passport with the goal of living between the Pacific Northwest and somewhere in the EU (most likely Italy), or perhaps the UK.</p>
       
       <p>My primary goal for learning web development is to assist fellow artists, musicians, independent venues and record labels in fulfilling IT-related requirements necessary to succeed in today's market, as well as having the ability to independently generate revenue remotely, from anywhere in the world.</p>
